# pandas-challenge
The District Summary portion of this assignment was straightforward.
I ran into some trouble with the School Summary section, specifically with calculating the total school budget and per capita spending code.
After trouble shooting with my instructors, peers, and even support, we decided it was best to create a new file and start from scratch.
For the remaining sections I used the following resources for the following functions.
    - In class activities for the pd.cut function and also for creating/organizing/labeling data frames.
    - Stack overflow for applying the groupby function.
